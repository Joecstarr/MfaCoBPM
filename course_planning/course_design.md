# Overall Course Design

## Stage 1 - Desired Results

### Established Goals

Project management is an important part of being a successful in academia as
well as industry. To take a project from ideation to a publishable product can
be easy when everything goes right. However, while completing a project issues
often arise that impact the ability to meet project goals. This course will
introduce project management concepts that will enable practitioners to mitigate
these hidden impacts.

The overarching theme for the course is:

> Be kind to future you.


### Transfer

_Students will be able to independently use their learning to…_

Students should leave this course knowing that there are tools to reach
for when planning in future projects. Additionally, students should have surface
understanding at least one specific tool to manage each section of the project
life cycle.

### Meaning

#### Understandings

_Students will understand that…_

* Products have long lives but projects die fast.
* Future you is a person that you need to collaborate with.
* Project documentation makes life easier
* Risk management from the "Indiana Jones School of Risk Management" is bad. 
* Projects fall behind "One day at a time" - Fred Brooks 

[Tho92] Thomsett, R., “The Indiana Jones School of Risk Management,” American Programmer, vol. 5, no. 7, September 1992, pp. 10–18. 


#### Essential Questions

* How do you ideate for a project? 
* How do you design a project plan?
* How do you evaluate risk?
* How do you do you create a project schedule?

### Acquisition

#### Students will know…

* How to use Crazy8s for ideation.
* How a basic project plan is used.
* How a risk management plan is used.
* How a project is scheduled.


#### Students will be skilled at…

Students will be able to utilize project management tools in practice. 

## Stage 2 - Evidence and Assessment

### Evaluative Criteria

* Students have a well formed project plan.
* Students have a well formed risk management plan.
* Students have a well formed project schedule.
* Students complete a project.

### Assessment Evidence


#### Performance Task(s):

Students will complete a collection of project management documents for their project. The course will culminate with a 1:1 retrospective meeting where the student will present their completed material and reflect on successes and failures in their planning. 

#### Other Evidence:

Students will have a touchpoint meeting every other week with meeting minutes summarized in a canvas reflection.
