# Week 3: Project Requirements

## Stage 1 - Desired Results

### Established Goals

After a project has been defined at a high level the next step is to refine
the project into goals and features. This week will describe how to define and
manage these goals and features in an organized way.

### Transfer

_Students will be able to independently use their learning to…_

Develop a coherent set of requirements for a project at a level that is
in the Goldilocks zone of abstraction.

### Meaning

#### Understandings

_Students will understand that…_

-   Project documentation makes life easier.
-   Stakeholder agreement is essential.

#### Essential Questions

-   How do you write down what "needs" to be done in a project?
-   How do you make sure all stakeholders agree?

### Acquisition

#### Students will know…

How to develop, phrase, and record a set of project requirements. Additionally,
how to communicate and agree on requirements with stakeholders.

#### Students will be skilled at…

Designing and documenting a set of project requirements.

## Stage 2 - Evidence and Assessment

### Evaluative Criteria

-   Students are expected to develop project requirements for their week 1 idea.

### Assessment Evidence

#### Performance Task(s):

-   Students will be asked to record a draft of their project requirements.

#### Other Evidence:

Students will be asked to reflect on their draft as part of their end of
semester portfolio.

## Stage 3 - Learning Plan: _Summary of Key Learning Events and Instruction_
<!--
In general

1. Group discussion:
    1. Students to think about:
        1. Outside of a classroom context what projects have you completed?
        2. When you started how did you know you could finish?
    2. Share thoughts
2. Introduce [the project management triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle)
3. Group discussion:
    1. Students to think about:
        1. Have you ever run into a situation where the triangle fell apart?
        2. Have you ever run into a situation where you thought a project would
            work and it didn't?
    2. Share thoughts
4. High level project documentation
    1. Repeat "Be kind to future you"
    2. Project feasibility by structure
    3. Go over project plan overview section
5. Group discussion:
    1. Students to think about:
        1. Is anything missing from the template? Why?
        2. Is there anything that should be removed from the template? Why?
    2. Share thoughts
3. Rules for a project
    1. As much as we would love for projects to be static after a kickoff as it
        turns out they are extremely not. Project stakeholders need to interact
        and negotiate changes over the lifetime of a project. Setting
        expectations early and clearly help facilitate effective and
        non-adversarial communication between stakeholders.
    2. Group discussion:
        1. Students to think about:
            1. What are some areas where rules should be defined? Why?
        2. Share thoughts
    3. Go over project template "Assessment and Control"
4. Group discussion:
    1. (time left*.5) Consider how you will fill out (and change) the template for your project.
    2. (time left*.5) Share what you're thinking. -->
