## Requirement Scope Description
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

```{note}
This section documents what the "shape" of a requirement is in this project.
Requirements describe what qualities will be used to evaluate project
completion. What should the "size"/scope of a requirement be? What is too
specific of a requirement for this project? What is not specific enough for
this project? What information must be included in all requirements?
```
