## High Level Description

```{note}
This section of the project plan describes the project at the highest level.
This section is completed after ideation.
```

### Objectives

```{note}
This subsection should describe what the project is trying to accomplish. What
are you trying to build?
```

### Purpose

```{note}
This subsection should describe the need being met by this project. Why is it
important that this be built?
```

### Scope

```{note}
This subsection should describe what will be completed in this project and also
what will not be completed. For example if the project is painting a kitchen
painting the walls are likely "in scope" but painting the cabinets or moving
appliances may be "out of scope".
```

### Deliverables

```{note}
This subsection should describe what the "completed" product this project is
building looks like. If you have a customer what do you hand to them at the
end? This could, and likely does, include "beta"/draft versions of the
deliverables at project milestones.
```

#### Milestones

```{note}
This subsubsection documents the project milestones and their deliverables,
quality goals, and agreed on delivery dates. Having specific milestones for the
project allows project members to see and feel the project progress. Further
milestones serve as a risk assessment tool.
```

### Infrastructure, tools, and methods

```{note}
This subsection of the project plan describes what "things" are needed to
complete the project. Do you need a specific tool to plan the project
(infrastructure)? Do you need a tool or procedure while constructing the
project? As an example, if the project is to build a wooden chest, you may need
a table saw to complete the project.
```

## Project Constraints

````{note}
This section describes limitations imposed on the project. These constraints
will inform the ```risk_management_plan``` as well as the ```schedule```.
````

(personnel)=

### Personnel

```{include} ./personnel_table.md

```

(timing)=

### Timing

```{note}
This subsection describes the timing constraints for the project. What is the
due date? Are there 'beta' releases described in deliverables. The combination
of this section and [SubSec. %s](#personnel) give the basis for determining the
schedule.
```

### Technological

```{note}
This subsection describes the technological constraints for the project.
Perhaps we're building a wood puzzle and don't have access to a laser cutter.
This might require us to reduce the scope/requirements of the project to a paper
model.
```

### Budget

```{note}
This subsection describes the monetary constraints for the project. How much do
we have to spend? Do the funds come in phases or as a lump sum?
```
