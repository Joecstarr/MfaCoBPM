_This section of the project plan describes the project at the highest level.
This section is completed after ideation_


### Objectives

are you trying to build?_

### Purpose

_This subsection should describe the need being met by this project. Why is it
important that this be built?_

### Scope

_This subsection should describe what will be completed in this project and also
what will not be completed. For example if the project is painting a kitchen
painting the walls are likely "in scope" but painting the cabinets or moving
appliances may be "out of scope"._

### Deliverables

_This subsection should describe what the "completed" product this project is
building looks like. If you have a customer what do you hand to them at the
end? This could, and likely does, include "beta"/draft versions of the deliverables at project milestones._

will inform the ```risk_management_plan``` as well as the ```schedule```._

##### Restrictions

### Timing

### Technological
_This subsection describes the technological constraints for the project. Perhaps we're building a wood puzzle and don't have access to a laser cutter._
