```{note}
This table contains should contain an overview of all risk cards for the
project. When in the ideation phase of risk analysis new risks should be added
to the table before any cards are created. The title field should contain a short
(one sentence) description of the risk. The risk ID should be unique for each
risk card (If cards are stored as separate files the ID should match the file
name). The impact, likelihood, and severity sections should be completed after
the risk card is created and filled out but before the management and mitigation
sections. When filling out the management and mitigation sections it's useful
to sort by severity.
