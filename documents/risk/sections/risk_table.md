```{note}
This table contains should contain an overview of all risk cards for the
project. When in the ideation phase of risk analysis new risks should be added
to the table before any cards are created. The title field should contain a
short (one sentence) description of the risk. The risk ID should be unique for
each risk card (If cards are stored as separate files the ID should match the
file name). The impact, likelihood, and severity sections should be completed
after the risk card is created and filled out but before the management and
mitigation sections. When filling out the management and mitigation sections
it's useful to sort by severity.
