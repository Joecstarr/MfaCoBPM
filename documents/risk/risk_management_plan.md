# Risk Item Checklists

## Generic Risk Item Checklist

_This subsection describes the risk item checklist for risk that is not project
specific. Risks generated by the generic checklist are usually lower impact.
Instead this high level checklist should assist in your building the checklist
in [SubSec. %s](#PSRIC). References: @@@TODO _

## Project Specific Risk Item Checklist

_This subsection describes the risk item checklist of project specific risks.
This checklist is specific to this project's idiosyncrasies.
References: @@@TODO _

# Risk Likelihood

_This section describes the categorization of risk likelihood. Presented here is
a sample likelihood table. The table describes likelihood levels used for the
project._

| Likelihood Level |                             Description                             |
| :--------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------: |
|        1         |        The likelihood that the event occurs is almost zero.         |
|        2         |             It is likely that the event will not occur.             |
|        3         |        It is more likely than not that the event will occur.        |
|        4         | The likelihood that the event occurs is almost one hundred percent. |

# Risk Impact

_This section describes the categorization of risk impact. Presented here is
a sample impact table. The table describes impact levels determined by worst
impact of one of the three legs of the project triangle._

| Impact Level |                                     Cost Impact                                      |                                 Schedule Impact                                 |                                      Quality Impact                                       |
| :----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|      1       | If the event was to occur the project will go over budget by more than **percent**%. | If the event was to occur the project will be late by more than **time frame**. | If the event was to occur the project quality will need to be lowered by **description**. |
|      2       | If the event was to occur the project will go over budget by more than **percent**%. | If the event was to occur the project will be late by more than **time frame**. | If the event was to occur the project quality will need to be lowered by **description**. |
|      3       | If the event was to occur the project will go over budget by more than **percent**%. | If the event was to occur the project will be late by more than **time frame**. | If the event was to occur the project quality will need to be lowered by **description**. |
|      4       | If the event was to occur the project will go over budget by more than **percent**%. | If the event was to occur the project will be late by more than **time frame**. | If the event was to occur the project quality will need to be lowered by **description**. |
|      5       |               If the event was to occur the project is unrecoverable.                |             If the event was to occur the project is unrecoverable.             |                  If the event was to occur the project is unrecoverable.                  |

# Risk Severity

_This section describes the concept of risk severity the project will adopt.
Given here is a sample description for defining severity._

| Likelihood Level/Risk Impact |     1      |   2    |   3    |   4    |    5    |
| :--------------------------: | :--------: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :-----: |
|              1               | Acceptable |  Low   | Medium | Medium | Extreme |
|              2               |    Low     |  Low   | Medium |  High  | Extreme |
|              3               |    Low     | Medium | Medium |  High  | Extreme |
|              4               |   Medium   |  High  |  High  |  High  | Extreme |

[@williamsPuttingRiskManagement1997]

Risk analysis activities should be prioritized by severity in the following
order:
1. Extreme
2. High
3. Medium
4. Low
5. Acceptable

_The level of detail required for the risk management and mitigation section
of the risk card is project specific and should be described here._
