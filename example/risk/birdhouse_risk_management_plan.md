# Risk Item Checklists

-   What current situations might have future negative consequences for the project?
-   What current risk strategies may fail?
-   What events have happened in past projects that might appear in this project?
-   What events may be caused by human resources?
-   What events may be caused by technological resources?

# Risk Likelihood

| Likelihood Level |                             Description                             |
| :--------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------: |
|        1         |        The likelihood that the event occurs is almost zero.         |
|        2         |             It is likely that the event will not occur.             |
|        3         |        It is more likely than not that the event will occur.        |
|        4         | The likelihood that the event occurs is almost one hundred percent. |

| 1            | If the event was to occur the project will go over budget by more than 10%. | If the event was to occur the project will be late by more than 1 day.     | If the event was to occur the project quality will need to be lowered by 10%. |
| 2            | If the event was to occur the project will go over budget by more than 20%. | If the event was to occur the project will be late by more than 2.5 days.  | If the event was to occur the project quality will need to be lowered by 20%. |
| 3            | If the event was to occur the project will go over budget by more than 50%. | If the event was to occur the project will be late by more than one week.  | If the event was to occur the project quality will need to be lowered by 50%. |
| 4            | If the event was to occur the project will go over budget by more than 70%. | If the event was to occur the project will be late by more than one month. | If the event was to occur the project quality will need to be lowered by 70%. |
| 5            |           If the event was to occur the project is unrecoverable.           | If the event was to occur the project is unrecoverable.                    | If the event was to occur the project is unrecoverable.                       |
