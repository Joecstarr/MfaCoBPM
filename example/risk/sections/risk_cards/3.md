#### Volunteer Availability and Commitment
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

##### Risk ID: 3

##### Description

When carrying out the dry run of the production strategy we will need a set of
volunteers. It is possible that not enough volunteers are available. Volunteers
may also commit but not show up for the dry run.

##### Likelihood: 3

##### Impact: 4

##### Mitigation

To lessen the chance that this event occurs an extra 20% of the needed
volunteers will be found for the dry run. This will ensure that the event will
run even with some cancellations or no-shows.

##### Management

If the event occurs all stakeholders will be informed immediately. A meeting
will be held as quickly as possible where timeline will be adjusted, and a new
dry run will be scheduled.
