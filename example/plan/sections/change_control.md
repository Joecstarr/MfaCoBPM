## Scope Change Control Plan
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Scope changes are acceptable at the following four points in the project life
cycle:

1. Project Kickoff
2. Post Release 1 (limited to blueprint requirements)
3. Post Release 2 (limited to production strategy requirements)
4. Post Release 4 (limited to minor changes to blueprint and/or production
   strategy requirements)

Any requested scope changes outside these time frames may not be considered.

A requested scope changes may incur additional cost and/or schedule delays. Cost
and schedule impact will be analyzed by the project team then summarized and
presented to the stakeholders for acceptance. When change analysis is presented
the stakeholder has a fixed window to accept the estimate, failure to respond
will be interpreted as non-acceptance and the scope change will not be taken up.

## Requirements Management Plan

Requirements will be stored as individual requirement cards as described in
[Sec. %s](#RSD). Requirement definition will be carried out by the project team.
Upon competition of requirement definition all cards will be supplied to
stakeholders for acceptance, as per [Sec. %s](#SCCP). Any deviation to
requirements will be communicated to and agreed on with an on demand process.

## Schedule Control Plan

The project will be scheduled as a collection of tasks. Tasks will be stored as
individual task cards. The project manager will monitor the health of the
project by monitory the project kanban board and its associated Gantt chart.
