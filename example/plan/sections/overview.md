## High Level Description


The project is to build a birdhouse production program for a non-profit.
The birdhouses will assist in the repopulation efforts of the endangered lesser
snipe.

### Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to construct a birdhouse production
program for a birdhouse that is quickly and efficiently reproducible. The
birdhouse must be producible by a team of volunteers with little to no
training out of cheap readily available materials.

### Purpose

The lesser snipe, a small and elusive bird, is facing a dire threat due to
habitat loss. Found primarily in wetlands and marshy areas, this bird relies on
these environments for nesting, feeding, and breeding. Unfortunately, rapid
urbanization, agricultural expansion, and climate change have led to the
destruction and degradation of these crucial habitats, pushing the lesser
snipe towards the brink of extinction.

The lesser snipe is known for its distinctive long bill and cryptic plumage,
which provides excellent camouflage among reeds and grasses. Despite its
remarkable adaptations, the bird's population has been steadily declining.
Conservationists are now sounding the alarm, emphasizing the urgent need to
protect and restore wetland habitats to ensure the survival of this species.

One effective way to support the lesser snipe is by building birdhouses and
creating safe nesting sites. By providing these shelters, we can help mitigate
the impact of habitat loss and offer a sanctuary for these birds to thrive.

### Scope


This project will create a design for the creation of a birdhouse. The design
will include a blueprint for the birdhouse as well as a production strategy.
Additionally to show proof of concept, a run of birdhouses will be produced with
the blueprint and production strategy.

The continued sourcing of materials as well as any supply chain considerations
will be considered out of scope for this project.

### Deliverables

The project will be considered complete when the following have been delivered
to the customer:

* A blueprint for birdhouses.
* A production strategy for birdhouses.
* A sample run of birdhouses with an after action report for the production
    strategy.

```{note}
This subsection should describe what the "completed" product this project is
building looks like. If you have a customer what do you hand to them at the
end? This could, and likely does, include "beta"/draft versions of the
deliverables at project milestones.
```

#### Milestones

```{note}
This subsubsection documents the project milestones and their deliverables, quality goals, and agreed on delivery dates. Having specific milestones for the project allows project members to see and feel the project progress. Further milestones serve as a risk assessment tool.
```

### Infrastructure, tools, and methods

```{note}
This subsection of the project plan describes what "things" are needed to complete
the project. Do you need a specific tool to plan the project (infrastructure)?
Do you need a tool or procedure while constructing the project? As an example,
if the project is to build a wooden chest, you may need a table saw to complete
the project.
```

## Project Constraints

````{note}
This section describes limitations imposed on the project. These constraints
will inform the ```risk_management_plan``` as well as the ```schedule```.

### Personnel

```{include} ./personnel_table.md

(timing)=

### Timing

```{note}
This subsection describes the timing constraints for the project. What is the
due date? Are there 'beta' releases described in deliverables. The combination
of this section and [SubSec. %s](#personnel) give the basis for determining the
schedule.
```

### Technological

```{note}
This subsection describes the technological constraints for the project.
Perhaps we're building a wood puzzle and don't have access to a laser cutter.
This might require us to reduce the scope/requirements of the project to a paper
model.
```

### Budget

```{note}
This subsection describes the monetary constraints for the project. How much do
we have to spend? Do the funds come in phases or as a lump sum?
