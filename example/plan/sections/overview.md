## High Level Description

The project is to build a birdhouse production program for a non-profit.
The birdhouses will assist in the repopulation efforts of the endangered lesser
snipe.

### Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to construct a birdhouse production
program for a birdhouse that is quickly and efficiently reproducible. The
birdhouse must be producible by a team of volunteers with little to no
training out of cheap readily available materials and tools.

### Purpose

The lesser snipe, a small and elusive bird, is facing a dire threat due to
habitat loss. Found primarily in wetlands and marshy areas, this bird relies on
these environments for nesting, feeding, and breeding. Unfortunately, rapid
urbanization, agricultural expansion, and climate change have led to the
destruction and degradation of these crucial habitats, pushing the lesser
snipe towards the brink of extinction.

The lesser snipe is known for its distinctive long bill and cryptic plumage,
which provides excellent camouflage among reeds and grasses. Despite its
remarkable adaptations, the bird's population has been steadily declining.
Conservationists are now sounding the alarm, emphasizing the urgent need to
protect and restore wetland habitats to ensure the survival of this species.

One effective way to support the lesser snipe is by building birdhouses and
creating safe nesting sites. By providing these shelters, we can help mitigate
the impact of habitat loss and offer a sanctuary for these birds to thrive.

### Scope

This project will create a design for the creation of a birdhouse. The design
will include a blueprint for the birdhouse as well as a production strategy.
Additionally to show proof of concept, a run of birdhouses will be produced with
the blueprint and production strategy.

The continued sourcing of materials as well as any supply chain considerations
will be considered out of scope for this project.

### Deliverables

The project will be considered complete when the following have been delivered
to the customer:

-   A blueprint for birdhouses.
-   A production strategy for birdhouses.
-   A sample run of birdhouses with an after action report for the production
    strategy.

#### Milestones

The project has the following milestones:
